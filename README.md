# PRJC-PropShield-Practice-Sketches
Repository of PropShield Sketchs

The Prop Shield is a combination of audio amplifier, LED driver and 10-dof motion sensor with 8MB of flash memory developed and sold by PRJC for their Teensy line of microprocessors.  For more information see https://www.pjrc.com/store/prop_shield.html.

This repository is a series of sketches that I used to test the Prop Shield with Motion Sensors.  Let me warn you that I did not develop any of the sketches in this library.  Most of them were developed by other users on the PRJC forum or are exmaple sketches from a couple of the associated libraries that you can load with Teensyduino.

This readme will document these sketches and my notes in learning a little about the audio and LED capabilities of the Prop Shield.
